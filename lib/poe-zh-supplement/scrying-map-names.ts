/**
 * Map-area names for the "Scrying Orb (<Map>)" currency variants whose map the
 * Taiwan trade API does NOT yet carry (the TW Atlas lags the international one),
 * so the language-independent `type`+`disc` pairing in build-item-map can't
 * reach them. Names sourced from PoeDB (poedb.tw /tw/ and /cn/ map pages), which
 * are the authentic 台服 / 国服 names — CN genuinely differs from a naive
 * OpenCC of TW for many maps (e.g. 远古街区 vs 血腥陣地).
 *
 * Keyed by the normalized English map name (lowercase, alphanumerics only —
 * same `normalize()` used in build-item-map). When the TW Atlas catches up,
 * the trade-API pairing will simply override these, so they are harmless
 * redundancy rather than something to maintain forever.
